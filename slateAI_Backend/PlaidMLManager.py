                The feedback we have received from our users indicates an ever-increasing need
                for performance, programmability, and portability. During the past few months,
                we have been restructuring PlaidML to address those needs.  To make all the
                changes we need to make while supporting our current user base, all development
                of PlaidML has moved to a branch â€” plaidml-v1. We will continue to maintain and
                support the master branch of PlaidML and the stable 0.7.0 release.
